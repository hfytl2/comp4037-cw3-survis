        "abstract": "The Hamming distance is a well-known measure that is designed to provide insights into the similarity between two strings of information. In this study, we use the Hamming distance, the optimal deviation model, and the generalized ordered weighted logarithmic averaging (GOWLA) operator to develop the ordered weighted logarithmic averaging distance (OWLAD) operator and the generalized ordered weighted logarithmic averaging distance (GOWLAD) operator. The main advantage of these operators is the possibility of modeling a wider range of complex representations of problems under the assumption of an ideal possibility. We study the main properties, alternative formulations, and families of the proposed operators. We analyze multiple classical measures to characterize the weighting vector and propose alternatives to deal with the logarithmic properties of the operators. Furthermore, we present generalizations of the operators, which are obtained by studying their weighting vectors and the lambda parameter. Finally, an illustrative example regarding innovation project management measurement is proposed, in which a multi-expert analysis and several of the newly introduced operators are utilized.",

        "abstract": "Information aggregation is a vital tool for human and machine decision making in the presence of uncertainty. Traditionally, approaches to aggregation broadly diverge into two categories, those which attribute a worth or weight to information sources and those which attribute said worth to the evidence arising from said sources. The latter is pervasive in the physical sciences, underpinning linear order statistics and enabling non-linear aggregation. The former is popular in the social sciences, providing interpretable insight on the sources. While prior work has identified the need to apply both approaches simultaneously, it has yet to conceptually integrate both approaches and provide a semantic interpretation of the arising aggregation approach. Here, we conceptually integrate both approaches in a novel joint weighted averaging operator. We leverage compositional geometry to underpin this integration, showing how it provides a systematic basis for the combination of weighted aggregation operators--which has thus far not been considered in the literature. We proceed to show how the resulting operator systematically integrates a priori beliefs about the worth of both sources and evidence, reflecting the semantic integration of both weighting strategies. We conclude and highlight the potential of the operator across disciplines, from machine learning to psychology.",

        "abstract": "Aggregation is the process of combining several numerical values into a single representative one, a procedure called an aggregation function. Despite the simplicity of this definition, the size of the field of its applications is incredibly huge. Making decisions (in also artificial intelligence) often leads to aggregating preferences or scores on a given set of alternatives. The concept of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator, a symmetric aggregation function that allocates weights according to the input value and unifies in one operator the conjunctive and disjunctive behavior, was introduced by Yager in 1988. Since then, these functions have been axiomatized and extended in various ways. OWA operators provide a parameterized family of aggregation functions, including many of the wellknown operators. This function has attracted the interest of several researchers, and therefore, a considerable number of articles in which its properties are studied and its applications are investigated have been published. The development of an appropriate methodology for obtaining the weights is still an issue of great interest. This work provides a short review of OWA operators and gives an overview of some of the most significant results.",

        "abstract": "Multiple linear regression (MLR) is one of the most widely used statistical procedures for scholarly and research. The main limitation of MLR is that when being estimated with linear methodologies as ordinary least squares (OLS) becomes not functional with complex data. The ordered weighted average (OWA) is an aggregation operator that provides means that collect complex information. This work presents a new application that uses MLR and OWA operators in the same formulation. We developed two applications called MLR-OWA operator and MLR-GOWA operator. The main advantage of the MLR with OWA operators is that we can consider the degree of optimism and pessimism of the environment. We study some of its main properties and particular cases. Finally, an application is tested for a volatility exchange rate estimation problem.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a new class of aggregation operator based on utility function, which introduces the risk attitude of decision makers (DMs) in the aggregation process. First, under the general framework of utility function, we provide a new operator called the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging (GOWUA) operator, and study its properties which are suitable for any utility function. Then, under the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility function, we propose another new operator named as the generalized ordered weighted utility averaging-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (GOWUA-HARA) operator, and further investigate its families including a wide range of aggregation operators. To determine the GOWUA-HARA operator weights, we put forward an orness measure of the GOWUA-HARA operator and analyze its properties. Considering that different DMs may have different opinions toward decision-making and their opinions can be characterized by different orness measures, we construct a new optimization model to determine the optimal weights which can aggregate all the individual sets of weights into an overall set of weights. Furthermore, based on the GOWUA-HARA operator, a method for the multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) is developed. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the application of the GOWUA-HARA operator to the MAGDM.",

        "abstract": "Induced ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators are important extensions of OWA operators and can suit more different decision environments. However, when practitioners perform induced OWA operators, they frequently do not consider the tied values in inducing information, therein lay the problem of possible non-uniqueness of aggregation results. From a novel perspective that can easily remove this flaw, this study uses a systematical frame to better redefine induced OWA operators, which not only covers all the spirits of the original definition of induced OWA operator but also extends it to some wider understandings and usages. One significant feature related to this frame is that we can express induced OWA operators fully in terms of weighted averaging operators, making the usages and expressions of induced OWA operators much more flexible and stricter. In detail, we propose several new definitions, such as positioning transformation, permutation-based orness, and inducing function based orness. As an example of flexibly formulating complex preferences under the proposed concepts, a novel investigators-consultants-decision maker (ICD) two-stage IOWA evaluation model is clearly proposed and illustrated.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a new perspective on how Zadeh's ideas related to fuzzy logic and computing with words have influenced the crucial issue of information aggregation and have led to what may be called a human-centric aggregation. We indicate a need to develop tools and techniques to reflect some fine shades of meaning regarding what can be considered the very purpose of human-centric aggregation, notably stated by various modalities in natural language specifications, in particular the usuality. We advocate the use of the ordered weighted average (OWA) operator, which is a formidable tool that can easily be tailored to a user's intention as to the purpose and method of aggregation, generalizing many simple and natural aggregation types, such as the arithmetic mean, maximum and minimum, and probability. We show some of the most representative extensions and generalizations, including the induced OWA, the generalized OWA, the probabilistic OWA, and the OWA distance. We show their use in the basic case of the aggregation of numerical values and in social choice (voting) results. Then, we claim that linguistic data summaries in Yager's sense can be considered an \u201cultimately human consistent\u201d form of human-centric aggregation and show how the OWA operators can be used therein.",
