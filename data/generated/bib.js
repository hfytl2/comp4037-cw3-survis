        "abstract": "This paper advocates the use of weighted ordered weighted averaging (WOWA) functions in decision-making processes, where the alternatives are not directly comparable. In particular, WOWA allows one to compare the strongest points of each alternative, also weighted by the importance of each criterion. Four different approaches to applying weights in OWA functions are reviewed. Torra's method based on interpolating regular increasing monotone quantifier and the pruned n-ary tree are compared to the WOWA obtained from recently proposed implicit averaging. Computationally efficient algorithms are outlined. The use of WOWA is illustrated in several examples.",

        "abstract": "Information aggregation is a vital tool for human and machine decision making in the presence of uncertainty. Traditionally, approaches to aggregation broadly diverge into two categories, those which attribute a worth or weight to information sources and those which attribute said worth to the evidence arising from said sources. The latter is pervasive in the physical sciences, underpinning linear order statistics and enabling non-linear aggregation. The former is popular in the social sciences, providing interpretable insight on the sources. While prior work has identified the need to apply both approaches simultaneously, it has yet to conceptually integrate both approaches and provide a semantic interpretation of the arising aggregation approach. Here, we conceptually integrate both approaches in a novel joint weighted averaging operator. We leverage compositional geometry to underpin this integration, showing how it provides a systematic basis for the combination of weighted aggregation operators--which has thus far not been considered in the literature. We proceed to show how the resulting operator systematically integrates a priori beliefs about the worth of both sources and evidence, reflecting the semantic integration of both weighting strategies. We conclude and highlight the potential of the operator across disciplines, from machine learning to psychology.",

        "abstract": "Aggregation is the process of combining several numerical values into a single representative one, a procedure called an aggregation function. Despite the simplicity of this definition, the size of the field of its applications is incredibly huge. Making decisions (in also artificial intelligence) often leads to aggregating preferences or scores on a given set of alternatives. The concept of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator, a symmetric aggregation function that allocates weights according to the input value and unifies in one operator the conjunctive and disjunctive behavior, was introduced by Yager in 1988. Since then, these functions have been axiomatized and extended in various ways. OWA operators provide a parameterized family of aggregation functions, including many of the wellknown operators. This function has attracted the interest of several researchers, and therefore, a considerable number of articles in which its properties are studied and its applications are investigated have been published. The development of an appropriate methodology for obtaining the weights is still an issue of great interest. This work provides a short review of OWA operators and gives an overview of some of the most significant results.",

        "abstract": "Multiple linear regression (MLR) is one of the most widely used statistical procedures for scholarly and research. The main limitation of MLR is that when being estimated with linear methodologies as ordinary least squares (OLS) becomes not functional with complex data. The ordered weighted average (OWA) is an aggregation operator that provides means that collect complex information. This work presents a new application that uses MLR and OWA operators in the same formulation. We developed two applications called MLR-OWA operator and MLR-GOWA operator. The main advantage of the MLR with OWA operators is that we can consider the degree of optimism and pessimism of the environment. We study some of its main properties and particular cases. Finally, an application is tested for a volatility exchange rate estimation problem.",

        "abstract": "Induced ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators are important extensions of OWA operators and can suit more different decision environments. However, when practitioners perform induced OWA operators, they frequently do not consider the tied values in inducing information, therein lay the problem of possible non-uniqueness of aggregation results. From a novel perspective that can easily remove this flaw, this study uses a systematical frame to better redefine induced OWA operators, which not only covers all the spirits of the original definition of induced OWA operator but also extends it to some wider understandings and usages. One significant feature related to this frame is that we can express induced OWA operators fully in terms of weighted averaging operators, making the usages and expressions of induced OWA operators much more flexible and stricter. In detail, we propose several new definitions, such as positioning transformation, permutation-based orness, and inducing function based orness. As an example of flexibly formulating complex preferences under the proposed concepts, a novel investigators-consultants-decision maker (ICD) two-stage IOWA evaluation model is clearly proposed and illustrated.",

This article presents new averaging aggregation operators by using sums and order inducing variables. This approach produces the induced ordered weighted average sum (IOWAS). The IOWAS operator aggregates a set of sums using a complex reordering process based on order-inducing variables. This approach includes a different types of aggregation structures including the well-known OWA families. The work presents additional generalizations by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means.

        "abstract": "A moving average is an average that aggregates a subset of variables from the set and moves across the sample. It is widely used in time-series forecasting. This paper studies the use of moving averages in some representative aggregation operators. The ordered weighted averaging weighted moving averaging (OWAWMA) operator is introduced. It is a new approach based on the use of the moving average in a unified model between the weighted average and the ordered weighted average. Its main advantage is that it provides a parameterized family of moving aggregation operators between the moving minimum and the moving maximum. Moreover, it also includes the weighted moving average and the ordered weighted moving average as particular cases. This approach is further extended by using generalized aggregation operators, obtaining the generalized OWAWMA operator. The construction of interval and fuzzy numbers with these operators obtaining the concept of moving interval number and moving fuzzy number is also studied. The paper ends analyzing the applicability of this new approach in some key statistical concepts such as the variance and the covariance and with a numerical example regarding sales forecasting.",

        "abstract": "Since Yager initially introduced the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator in 1988, it has been used to aggregate multiple decision-maker attitudes to yield an overall decision. This article uses science mapping analysis to provide an overview of the types and applications of OWA operators. The main goals are to discuss the OWA development path, its formulas and possible extensions in the literature, and the identification of the domains where the OWA operators have been most used. The results verify that, on the one hand, the OWA operators have been primarily used in the decision-making system; on the other hand, it can be extended by including various measurements into the OWA operator's formula. OWA and its applications have been expanding in a variety of fields, including computer science, business, economics, environment and natural resource, finance, geography, mathematics, and so on. The main use of the OWA operators in multiple application fields is to select the optimal strategy or plan by calculating the weight or importance of different criteria and taking into account the attitudinal character or degree of optimism of the decision-maker. In a word, this paper examines over 19,000 articles indexed by Web of Science, whose main contribution is to provide some future research directions on OWA.",

We consider the problem of performing a prescribed OWA aggregation in the case when we have a probability distribution over the argument values. We show how we use the weight generating function to enable this type of aggregation. Next we consider the situation when we have a more general measure based uncertainty over the argument values.
